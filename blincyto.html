        <h2>1. Indications and Usage</h2>
        <h3>1.1 MRD-positive B-cell Precursor ALL</h3>
        <p>Blincyto is indicated for the treatment of CD19-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1% in adult and pediatric patients one month and older.</p>
        
        <h3>1.2 Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Precursor ALL</h3>
        <p>Blincyto is indicated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CD19-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adult and pediatric patients one month and older.</p>
        
        <h3>1.3 B-cell Precursor ALL in the Consolidation Phase</h3>
        <p>Blincyto is indicated for the treatment of CD19-positive Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the consolidation phase of multiphase chemotherapy in adult and pediatric patients one month and older.</p>

        <h2>2. Dosage and Administration</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Treatment of MRD-positive B-cell Precursor ALL</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A treatment course consists of 1 cycle of Blincyto for induction followed by up to 3 additional cycles for consolidation.</li>
            <li>A single cycle of treatment of Blincyto induction or consolidation consists of 28 days of continuous intravenous infusion followed by a 14-day treatment-free interval (total 42 days).</li>
            <li>See Table 1 for the recommended dose by patient weight and schedule. Patients weighing 45 kg or more receive a fixed-dose. For patients weighing less than 45 kg, the dose is calculated using the patientâ€™s body surface area (BSA).</li>

            <li>Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in patients receiving Blincyto. Interrupt or discontinue Blincyto and treat with corticosteroids as recommended.</li>
            <li>Neurological toxicities, including immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) which may be severe, life-threatening, or fatal, occurred in patients receiving Blincyto. Interrupt or discontinue Blincyto as recommended.</li>
